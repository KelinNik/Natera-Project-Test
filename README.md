# Natera-Test-Project

1. Test documentation with tests and some bugs might be found via the link [TestDocumentation](https://natera-project-test.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TP/pages/425990/Test+Documentation)

2. To run tests it is preferable to use terminal command: `mvn clean test`
3. To open allure http page a command `mvn allure:serve` might be used

4. Also, it is added Postman collection in source of project (Natera.postman_collection.json)

5. Comments: There are not all possible cases were described and I sure that there are more bugs, than I found.
